# Web-Design-Challenge

The mystery continues...websites while so ubiquitious are a challenging item to create and make look professional.  This project

was my first attempt at making a website and I learned a lot and learned that I have a lot more to learn!  We took some of the 

data we researched in a previous project on APIs and weather and created a website to display our findings on the impact of the

earth's latitude on various elements of the weather.
